Ettins, however, proved to be perfect subjects. An ettin's two brains provide sufficient food for two tadpoles, and the two tadpoles are able to transform the entirety of the ettin's body, creating an ettin ceremorph. As part of the transformation process, one of the ettin's heads sinks into the body, with that brain focused on controlling the body. The other head focuses on cogitation and psionic power, though its power is not as great as a mind flayer's.",

As he grew older, learned more about the world, and began to feel the weight of old age, his worldview changed dramatically. Motivated by his growing fear of death, Bak Mei became obsessed with living an unending life. He began collecting texts on the subject, consulting with practitioners of the necromantic arts, and seeking audiences with dark forces.",

It remains motionless as it waits for prey to come close.

Only a scattering of bones, metal, treasure, and other indigestible bits is left behind.",

Antigravity technology and built-in tractor beams allow worker robots to effortlessly lift cargo and other heavy objects with their mechanical tentacles, which double as weapons if the robots are threatened or drafted for security purposes. A worker robot's voice is often utilitarian, programmed to use simple phrases without embellishment. Worker robots designed to be in public view\u2014such as units that carry out deliveries, repairs, or transportation\u2014have voices that more closely mimic those of their creators. These robots employ mollifying phrases or make shallow but pleasant small talk.",

By resisting the curse, a lycanthropickle retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its boring life as it always has, burying deep its raging, murderous urges just like the rest of us.\n\nSome individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. They can assume pickle form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropickles that embrace their briny natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.\n\nIn hybrid form, a lycanthropickle has the same statistics as a twig blight with the altered ability noted here.\n\nIn pickle form, a lycanthropickle has no statistics and is indistinguishable from a pickle... because it's a pickle.*",

    "description": "Spellcasters of any sort among the goblins are rare. Goblins typically lack the intelligence and patience needed to learn and practice wizardry, and they fare poorly even when given access to the necessary training and knowledge. Sorcerers are less prevalent among them than in many other races, and Khurgorbaeyag seems to dislike sharing his divine power with his followers. And although many goblins would readily offer anything to have the abilities of a warlock, the patrons that grant such power know a goblin is unlikely to be able to uphold its end of any bargain.",

The insidious archfey then befriended Isolde and offered to help her forget her terrible losses. Isolde became the master of a traveling fey carnival that served as a gateway to Zybilna's domain.
